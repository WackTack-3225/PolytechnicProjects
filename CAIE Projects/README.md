# Introduction

This is my submissions for 2 projects

1) 2024 Pets Prepared **CASE STUDY** 

*(It is not to be confused with the 2024 AIP Competition, this will be addressed later on)*

2) 2024 OLIST **Technical Assessment**

*(This is the official submission for my CAIE technical test)*

**Note:** I have censored all fields containing my private information. It has been replaced with general terms or ####\. to block out these information

# What they are

1) Pets Prepared 
> This project used the [pets_prepared](https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-adoption-prediction/data) dataset found on Kaggle to:
> 1) Better Understand adopter's preferences (Data Science)
> 2) Predict the Adoption Rate (Data Engineering)

2) OLIST
> This project used the [Brazilian Olist Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) found on Kaggle to:
> * Identify Potential Repeat Buyers

# Background on me with CAIE Projects
>My first experience with **CAIE** and this type of projects was through the **AIP Compeititon 2024**. Initially, I was not able to submit a finished copy, let alone begin on the Machine Learning Pipeline (or in actuality, the `run.sh file`). At that time, I just finished Year 2 of my studies in Nanyang Polytechnic and had a basic knowledge of what Data Preparation, Visualisation and Machine Learning is. However, I have never done or seen both sections combined and the requirements of a pipeline. It was the first time I realised that I had much more to learn in this field.

>My 2nd time touching the **Case Study** was in preparation for the **Technical Test**. The Case Study provided by the school was the exact copy of the AIP Competition. However, this time I had learnt and also seen what a basic pipeline looks like. Additionaly, I also had a bit more expereince on what a Data Engineer truly was. After doing both the Data Analysis and Machine Learning sections, it gave me a solid foundation on how to begin on my upcoming **Technical Test** a few weeks later. 
> - My Goal for this was to just be able to create and run a Data Processing and Machine Learning Pipeline together. Thankfully, it seems that I was able to.

> The **Technical Test** was my official submission for the CAIE certification exam. With the knowledge from **pets_prepared**, I attempted this thinking that I could just adapt and use the sections I've already done and improve on them. However, nothing could have prepared me for this as I genuinely never experienced such a hard time making insights that made logical sense. 
> 1) Firstly, the dataset really was just order informations, and had no clear feature for what a repeat customer is. 
> 2) Secondly, I experienced many roadblocks in just thinking of what I could do with the data since many fields like product information and such didn't really make sense to use with my insights, and I could not explore all of them without hitting the 20 page limit. Furthermore, this was done in-between projects, tests and school.
> I realised that the insights I made were not deep or reasonable even after such a long time, and I spent too much time just thinking about it rather than doing it.
> However, I did manage to create a pretty solid pipeline with Kedro as an achievement. Although the pipeline is reasonably crude due to certain forced encodings. 

> Ultimately, the Achilles Heel in both of official submission was myself. I only ever really forced myself to just do whatever i could only days before the deadline. It did allow me to get past the mental blocks but in the end resulted in honestly, work not very acceptable within the industry standards. I do realise I have a lot to work on, especially just getting myself to see and clean the data before thinking whether its useless or not. Perhaps in the future if do similar projects I should try to keep an open mind on what data given to me means and really let the data take the lead rather than my logic.
